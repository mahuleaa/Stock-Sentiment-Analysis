How to come out of 35L debt in the form of personal loans which I lost in trading.,"Please help me! 

I am a software professional earning over 1.3L per month since last two years. 

Without proper understanding about trading and markets, I started trading in 2020 and by now I have lost over 66L in total, out of which around 50L was taken as loans. 

Over the past two years I have been able to pay the EMIs with my salary and now the total EMIs are more than my salary and I am unable to last two months EMI. 

I still have around 35L of loan to be repaid. I am out of any options now, I am struggling to keep up with my mental stability and getting suicidal thoughts. 

Kindly help me to get out of this situation.

I have the ability survive in IT industry with my current job. But with the increase in pressure from the lenders for my personal loan, I could  foresee  that I might loose this job as well. 

I don't know how to handle this situation. ",[],0.3,0.0,0.38517094017094017,0.05153846153846153
Markets is only for ULTRA RICH,"I may be hated for such a post but I just got to say it. 

Too much retail money is flowing into the markets. To individual stocks and via mutual funds. So if I‚Äôm in a position of power or I have a lot of money. My investment would make less sense and the average retail investor would be making better returns than a millionaire.

How do the ultra rich and Banks and therefore government stop this and keep all the money to themselves? Ultimately they are the market and policy makers

1.	‚Å†FM Sitharaman may increase the tax on CAPITAL GAINS both LTCG and STCG. I‚Äôm pretty much certain this will happen in the next budget.(post election)

2.	‚Å†NSE/BSE will hike their charges for futures and options drastically . May be lesser for stocks. TAXES / stamp duties will also increase.

3. Mutual funds will increase their expense ratios back by policy Rejig and regulations. 

4.	‚Å†There may be an crash, it may dramaticised to such an extent that the average retail investor like you and me will remove all our money from the markets. There will be a play like there‚Äôs blood on the streets. Then at the lowest point the ultra rich will pump in all the money. The low will be lower than the low you have in mind. 

It‚Äôs easy in a bull market to say, I‚Äôm in it for the long term. Just ride the low and pump in more money at lows. Any retail investor will do that. But most will run out money after a YEAR OR TWO. You will start thinking about taking money out since you‚Äôre getting only negative returns. That‚Äôs when the ultra rich enter. 

MARKETS NEVER FAVOUR THE AVERAGE RETAIL INVESTOR. Markets are made by the ultra rich and it will always favour them. MARKETS is not an EQUAL GROUND. They just spin you the story but it is definitely not a fair ground.

This all only a PROBABILTY. But it‚Äôs not like it has never happened. ",['ULTRA'],0.875,0.1875,0.525669642857143,0.058779761904761904

What are some of the most undervalued stock right now for long term?,"By long term I mean atleast 5-10 years. Here are some of my finds:


1. Anuh Pharma: Has already given a return of 162.2% in a year but I feel it's due for more. With a PE of 19.73, it's lower than it's competitors. A company with 0 debt, increasing sales and profit growth, stable ROE and ROCE. One downside is it's a family owned company with promoter holdings around 70%. Any dispute within the family and the share may tank.           




2. Hindalco: Already someone posted it as being the next multibagger for long term. High increase in sales in last years and is supposed to increase even more during or after the elections.            





3. REC Ltd and PFC: Very good PSU stocks which are rising and will probably rise even higher. Lot of analysis already on this sub regarding these stocks, so won't add more. 

           


4. Ashok Leyland: Kind of a cyclic stock which has been moving sideways for a long time. Very good financials and they are trying to expand their buisness by entering into the overseas market with exports to Africa. Sales and profit growth has increased in the last 3 years. May breakout from the 170 zone very soon.

Another rally,"This is going to be a long post so you can ignore if you don‚Äôt want to read some geeky stuff. Our markets rallied on Friday after GDP numbers, yes the numbers have beaten expectations but as the experts are saying that we might not sustain such numbers because of the fact that private consumption is still not growing. Now coming to the stock markets, few days ago I posted about most of the stocks, especially the PSUs being too expensive and since then there has been some correction in them. But I think there‚Äôs room for more and it will come unexpectedly and eat a lot of gains that people have made since November. The gains people are getting in quant funds are not sustainable as markets cannot grow unreasonaby high every year, I also got a feeling that people in this sub are not very open to discussions but they like to hate on someone saying that the stock they bought is overvalued. My father has been in the markets since the time of Harshad Mehta, he has seen how people lose most of their gains and incur huge losses bcz of operators. If a correction comes, it may turn out to be deep enough to make 80-90% of retail traders stuck with losses and you‚Äôll not be able to figure out if you should hold or just exit at whatever loss you might be bearing. I have studied economics and even the analysts, economists are sure that India‚Äôs domestic demand is not anywhere near the west and we‚Äôre just being too optimistic about the Indian companies. To those who are defending PSU stocks, just think wisely that these companies work for welfare and working on welfare can‚Äôt make you huge profits, same goes with the PSU banks, if all of us are investing and not keeping money in the banks, then these banks will lose deposits and Idk how will they even be profitable without having enough funds. This post is not to hurt someone‚Äôs sentiments but just an advice to people that making 40-50% return in 2-3 months is great but book your profits before it‚Äôs too late. I‚Äôm not hating on any partifular company but what I‚Äôm trying to say is that domestic consumptions is too low to facilitate the profits that corporates and the government are promising.

1 . Rajesh Exports
I saw the revenues and the portfolio of the company. The company manages processing of gold  . It process about 35% of total gold in the world. However , there is an sharp decline in the profitability of the company. 

2.  Piramal Enterprises .
This company is a lot controversial to most of you because of its poor performance this days . However this company is well diversified.

However, if the management works hard in turning the tables of these companies, a big turnaround could be seen in the companies .

Are Private Banks Undervalued? Let's Discuss!," 

Hey fellow investors, let's dive into the current market dynamics. After the recent rollercoaster ride in PSU sectors, it seems like the stock market is gearing up for a sideways movement for the next couple of months, possibly hovering around 21,000.

In light of this, I've significantly increased my holdings in the Private Bank sector, focusing on stalwarts like HDFC, AU Bank, and City Union Bank. What caught my attention is their comparatively low PE ratios and impressive growth rates. These banks make up a substantial chunk of my portfolio.

Interestingly, the PE of this sector is below average, with most banks sporting a PE less than 20. What are your thoughts on the potential undervaluation of private banks? Let's discuss and share insights!

What is Free Float Market Cap?,"For upto date NEWS and analysis follow my community r/updateindia 

TCS is the ranked 2nd by market cap in India

But ranks 6th in Nifty weights

Reliance - largest by market cap, but ranked 2nd in Nifty!

SBI is 7th largest by market cap, but does not appear in top 10 in Nifty weightage.

Why?

The answer lies in the fact that Nifty index is based on Free Float Market cap, and not total Market Cap.

But what is Free Float Market Cap?

It is assumed that promoter holding is not free to be traded in the markets.

Promoters are unlikely to sell their stake.

So if a promoter has 70% stake, then only the remaining 30% is considered free to trade.

This 30% is the free float.

If the market cap of the company was Rs 10,000 crore, then free float market cap is 30% X 10,000 = Rs 3000 crore.

Nifty weights are decided based on the free float.

Tata Sons has 72% stake in TCS.

Thus, while overall market cap is Rs 15 lakh crore, free float market cap goes down to approximately Rs 4 lakh crore.

Thus reducing its weightage in Nifty

Infosys has nearly 15% promoter holding, ICICI Bank has 0%. Thus their free float market cap is higher than that of TCS.

Hence they rank higher in Nifty index weightage.

Why is this important - If you are looking at portfolio management, the benchmarking is done against an index. The weight to stocks in the index is an important consideration in portfolio creation!

Building a portfolio : Avoid common mistakes when rejecting & selecting Stocks ‚Äî Part 2/n,"#  Avoid common mistakes when stock picking ‚Äî

1\] There are two types of risk in investment ‚Äî Risk from known and  from unknown. If you are investing before reading at least 8 Annual  reports of the company, you will not have knowledge to counter 1st kind  of risk. **2nd kind of risk you can't counter or prepare for, you have to accept this while investing.**

2\] **Don't invest in an unproven business model, you are not a private equity farm**. Let them prove and invest with greater safety/lesser known-risk.

3\] **Don't follow others, do your own research as thoroughly as possible**.  Don't buy a stock just because some famous investors bought it.  Remember, a big investor having net worth of 500 crores may buy a stock  of 50 crores and if stock price goes to 0, then he/she still have 450  crores. But following him/her if you invested 2 Crores in that single  stock (where your net worth is itself 2.25 Crores) and lost all, then  your net worth is now just 25 Lakhs.

4\] **No point of buying a stock just because a promoter bought** 10 Lakh shares (which is 0.25% to total share capital). **Similarly no point of selling either**. But if there is a ***change in controlling stake*** (like Promoter holding goes to 75% to 40% or 51% to 70%) then consider your decision accordingly.

5\] **Stop wasting on your time on Buy/Sell calls given by research analysts/Mutual Fundhouses**.  Reading research report to understand the sector is ok, but if you read  them for 1 year (better, if you read them for 1 complete market cycle  i.e bull to bear to bull again) you will understand that they are more  of a storyteller than giving opinion based on facts and logic.   

6\] **Don't buy a stock just because it got a very big order**.  Let's say a Company having 1000 Crore Mcap got a order of 6000 crores.  But if it operates at a NPM of 5%, then from that order it can add only  300 Crores of profit. Moreover, if it takes 4 years to complete that  order then that profit to be counted in next 4 years, so this year  impact will be around 75 Crores. So effective impact is around 7.5% with  respect to it's Market Cap.

7\] **Don't be happy if a company gives a great projection/guidance, it is their job is to do so**.  Rarely you will see a company (except big banks) giving a moderate or  bad projection beforehand, rather they will give it after one or two bad  quarterly result. And check claims vs performances from the past.

8\] 2ndly, it is better **if the company gives a guidance of moderate projection** (say 20-22% growth) and **delivers better results** (26-28% growth) **than to give a astounding projection of 30% growth and then delivering a growth of 28% (even 30%)**.  Because, if you did not already owned that stock at the time of giving  guidance then at first stock will run up much faster and higher (hearing  that 30% projection), and when it will not be able to outperform it  then the price will move sideways (even it can have small dip).

9\] Most of the time, the price does not move based on performance of the company; rather than the **price movement depends on the expected performance vs reality**.

10\] **Insider buying is very much prevalent in India**,  you will notice many stock price to run up high or low and then see the  publish a very good/bad result. But as a beginner investor remember  that **it is better to arrive late at a party which already  started than to arrive beforehand and after much waiting you found that  the party is not happening there.**

11\] If you **don't understand the macroeconomics factors**, then even if are not going to invest, **read the Annual reports and conference calls of big banks**  (like SBI, HDFC, ICICI) as they normally give conservative projections  and will warn about a problem beforehand. Staple consumer goods  Companies (like Nestle, Hul, Marico etc) also helps to understand  consumption in masses.

12\] But don't be bothered too much with macroeconomic factors,  because even the govt can not predict them accurately. As Buffet said - *It is better to be approximately right, than to be precisely wrong.*

13\] If you think you are in a peak of bull market and it is going to  end within a 1 or 2 months and you exit from market, but then in next  quarter you find that bull run is still continuing, **don't jump again with a lumpsum investment**. Even Newton made this mistake.  
Instead,  start investing in a index MF by weekly/monthly SIPs with a goal of 8  years. It is not that in your lifetime you will be see only one bull  market; take lessons from the present bull market and apply those in the  next one.

14\] **Don't think yourself as a owner of the business when your are not.**  You are not Warren Buffet, you are a minority shareholders. Shareholders activism is almost absent in India, many times majority  shareholders make profits at the cost of the minority shareholders. **Don't get too much attached to the business**, if business model or sector itself is in a problem and you can find a better opportunity, then leave this problem and jump to that.

15\] As Peter Lynch said, **first go to the sector which you are most familiar with when picking a stock**. If you are a doctor, then check Pharma stocks; if you are a Chemical  engineer, then check Chemical sector. It will be easier to understand a  known territory than an unknown one.

16\] **When you get a fresh capital for investment, 1st check  whether you can invest in the stocks which are already in your portfolio, if not only then check for newer opportunities**. As  there might be an better opportunity always, but having more companies  in your portfolio requires far greater research which is not easy for a  retail investor due to time constraints.

17\] **Understand the sector to check for average PE (growth projection) than just finding it from a site like moneycontrol or screener** etc; if everything is ok, good companies (Sector leading) will trade at a much higher valuation than 2nd or 3rd best.

18\] **Instead of checking price or P/E, it is better to check PEG** (except for cyclicals and Bank+NBFCs). In today's world, due to fast  and easily available information, it is almost impossible to find good  companies at low valuations unless it is in some big problem.

19\] In today's world where companies are trying to use asset-light  models for running the business, checking P/B values will confuse you (except for Banking & NBFCs because their growth depends on Loan book size).

20\] Given time, big companies can also fail. **So never feel secured buying a Large Cap**, specially in India where corporate governance is a mystery.

21\] **Don't make too much focus on Market cap, instead focus on potential growth**.  A large company with higher valuation might perform better than a small  company available at lower valuation for a long period.

22\] For Cyclicals, the goal is here to enter when companies are exiting the bottom when sector is just starting improving; and to exit  when the companies have reached the peak and starting to have problem to maintain the growth. Check the sector situation thoroughly before investing.

23\] Prefer to invest in Companies which have a **great sales and revenue growth project with moderately high GPM and ROE** (at least at moderate valuations).

24\] With modern business models, prefer investing in companies having **Negative Cash Conversion Cycle** i.e. purchases on credit and sells in Cash.

25\] **In a bull market, concentration of portfolio does not matter much**  because going at it's peak, almost every good company will give you  good returns. Yes, you might be missing a chance of 10xing your  portfolio but will still have 3-4x returns. But concentration is the key  in a bear (or even normal) market. In another words - **Everybody is a genius in bull market!**

Thoughts on Reliance Industries!?,"I‚Äôm a long time shareholder of Reliance industries. Been hold for like more than 3 years had been super bullish but the share price hardly moved for years. Now it‚Äôs up around 40%.

2. I purchased more when Mukesh Ambani said he would invest 75000 crores in green hydrogen. But still no action or announcement. 

3. They spend a lot on things like NMACC and VANTARA ZOO. I‚Äôm confused, who‚Äôs money is it? Is it from their personal capacity or is it funds from RIL ? 


4. The Disney Jio deal was supposed to happen at a much higher valuation but it didn‚Äôt. As a shareholder I‚Äôm happy but where is the extra money ? 

See I‚Äôm a big fan of the ambanis that‚Äôs why I have been super bullish but that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm holding reliance shares in a considerable amount for me .

Why there is a Euphoria around trading 0dte options?,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xi50xypxmnmc1.png?width=1051&format=png&auto=webp&s=26ba3c1992151ed03a034794ad72c312a314b5fd

&#x200B;

The decline in equity market volatility (VIX) during much of 2023 despite persistent uncertainty, particularly from interest rate dynamics and geopolitical tensions, presents a perplexing scenario. Some analysts attribute this decline to the increasing popularity of trading in zero-days-to-expiry (0DTE) options on the S&P 500, Nifty50 index, positing that it has diverted trading activity away from the traditional one-month-to-expiry (1MTE) options, thereby reducing demand for the latter and subsequently suppressing VIX. However, above analysis suggests that the surge in 0DTE trading hasn't significantly **siphoned activity from one-month options and thus may not be the primary factor behind the VIX drop**. Instead, we propose an alternative explanation: **option dealers are effectively mitigating volatility as they hedge structured products, which have gained prominence recently**.

&#x200B;

The uptick in trading volume for 0DTE options in recent years can be attributed to their relatively low cost and potential for exceptionally high returns, albeit with low odds of occurrence, which appeals to certain investors. These options, accounting for over 50% of trading volume for S&P 500 index options in August 2023, have seen a remarkable increase from just 5% in 2016 and even much higher for India. The allure of 0DTE options lies in their ability to offer substantial leverage, with leverage ratios surpassing 400 in some instances. While investing in these options typically results in negative average returns, with annualized returns plummeting to -32,000%, sporadic instances yield extraordinarily high returns of up to 79,000%. These returns exhibit significantly greater volatility compared to those of one-month options, which demonstrate an average return of -550% annualized and a maximum of 2,500%.

  

While the surge in trading activity for zero-days-to-expiry (0DTE) options has been notable in recent years, it is improbable to solely account for the decline in VIX for two main reasons. Firstly, despite the growth of both instruments, one-month options continue to be disproportionately favored over 0DTE options for obtaining actual exposure to the market index itself. Secondly, the trading activity in 0DTE options does not directly influence the pricing of one-month options and thus the VIX, given that the latter is predicated on a one-month maturity period, whereas 0DTE options expire on the day of trading.

&#x200B;

**The theory of short VIX exchange-traded funds (ETFs) selling VIX futures, presumed to have contributed to the VIX drop in 2017‚Äì18, is also less likely to explain the recent decline in VIX.** Despite the potential of these ETFs to exert downward pressure on VIX by selling futures on the volatility index, recent years have shown a net positive demand for VIX futures by VIX ETFs, contradicting the notion that pressure from VIX futures sales by ETFs is a significant driver of the VIX decrease.

&#x200B;

A more plausible explanation for the compression of volatility is the proliferation of yield-enhancing structured products from firms like Susquehana. These products aim to boost yield by offering higher returns to investors through the sale of options. One common example is the ""covered call"" strategy, where investors purchase the S&P 500 index while simultaneously selling a one-month call option on the index. This strategy provides exposure to the index while generating a yield enhancement through the premium income from selling the call option. By selling these structured products, dealers acquire option exposure and hedge it by trading in the underlying asset ‚Äì the equity index ‚Äì based on its price movements, a practice known as ""dynamic hedging."" This hedging behavior, which involves buying when the index declines and selling when it rises, acts contrarily to market movements, thereby dampening volatility. Consequently, as volatility decreases, so does the cost of hedging against it, as evidenced by declining option prices. This market dynamic could elucidate why the VIX may decline even amidst heightened uncertainty. Notably, the rise of yield-enhancing structured products linked to the S&P 500 has coincided with the drop in VIX over the past two years, suggesting the influence of this mechanism on volatility compression.

What does it mean for Indian stock market?

A Gammageddon or call it Volmageddon is coming for the Indian stock market either in March 2024 or between September OPEX - October OPEX period coz vol is not well supplied in India on weekly basis. You will not be able to hedge for this event coz as you start buying put options there are entities within India that understand dealer flow positioning ( vana charm flows ) on a deeper level and rather than market going down it will start melting up. So, the only way to hedge for this event is using Nassim Taleb approach and reading his works and do nothing once you read this post. Once you understand how fat tail game works i guarantee you market will drop -10% atleast to -20% within a 14day period.

Now I have two questions: 

1. Now this 10K profit that I booked will he considered as Intraday gain and I will be taxed 20% on it? But If we look it the other way, I didn't make any profit today, because my buying and selling price today is still the same.

2. Now the long term holding status from the stock will go away, the counter will reset to day-1?

How Forex Brokers who claim to be legal in India (Exness) is Making a mockery of you,"

**Brokers always win,  even when it comes to fooling you** 

**What attracts Gen Z and newbies into forex** 

As published in article 1 regarding TA,  you must have remembered i  said that TA works quite good in FX due to its liquidity,   Now in  recent times this as influenced a plethora of new beginners who are  starting to enter Forex markets,   everything would have been fine but  in India,  Forex trading of NON\_INR pairs is not allowed.   To explain  you what it means you cant trade EUR/GBP,   But you can trade EUR/INR.   

**Issues with indian pairs** 

Most top brokers in India will allow FNO section of these  currencies. Now you might be thinking,  well if thats the case hmma just  trade USD/INR  let me stop you right there,   Why a lot of people dont  like trading currencies in indian market is that   

&#x200B;

1. Low movement in the currencies     
 
2.    Options premiums are very low,   its beneficial for option buyers  but not for seller.   And for you to buy something,  there must be  someone ready to sell that instrument as well to you hence the low  volume     
 

\~\~ not to mention   

3. Demands for calls is higher in usdinr since india is import  dependent country, businesses looks       hedge risk of inr depreciation  and hence buy calls,it will be opposite for china which is an export  driven country   (said by techlund in ISB discord)   

**\*\*Data and simulation\*\*** 

As recorded on 19 Feb,  USDINR futures volume was pretty much dead,    there was no point buying or selling it and the big bois in the market  is basically RBI who is managing USDINR too much posing more risk.   

Imagine a scenario,   its thursday afternoon,  you are sitting on  your couch selling usdinr contracts,   everything seems to be going  well.  OOPS RBI just influxed another million dollar and fucked your  positions to oblivion, (for reference,   we hit a mark of 600 billion  usd fx reserves last year,   we spent around 1 billion every week during  high inflationary period,  went down till 550ish billion,  now we are  back at 617 as on march 1 but at a cost as well .  that is higher USD  INR exchange rate,  what it means in layman term is that,  Earlier 1 usd  =70rs, now 1usd = 82rs) You want to exit the position?  on rare  occasions theres no one ready to buy that and now you blew up your  account.   

You went from having a good life to your wife leaving you along with the kids because of your USDINR   trades   

**\*\*Retailers looking for solution to this problem\*\*** 

Whats the solution to this problem for naive Indian retailers?   trade EUR/USD,  one of the most liquid currencies in the world,  GBP/USD  ,  JPY/USD etc etc. But we cant due to restriction made by the Foreign  Exchange Management Act, 1999. I wont go too deep into FEMA because it  would become a law lecture at that point,  but basically thats the  reason ,  the objective of FEMA  was to help aid Indian economy In the  most layman terms, FEMA basically protects India's foreign reserves and  helps the economy and government doesn't want you meddle into that   

But for every problem we have a solution ,  Indian traders soon  started opening up FX trading accounts in foreign unauthorized brokers.  Now we come to the crux of the issue,  Most of these brokers including  some major names like Exness ,FXTM .   I myself have heard people  claiming to be trading via exness.they says exness allows them to do  that,   What they dont realize is EXNESS is making a mockery out of you,   and so does every other broker who you think is providing you the  service to trade in FX   

**\*\*EXNESS's Issues and hypocrisy\*\*** 

Exness claims to have Multiple regulatory licenses   

Under company's website link  they say [https://trading-platform.in/exness-regulation](https://trading-platform.in/exness-regulation) **The  company is a licensed broker and is regulated by reputable  organizations in many countries around the world. Also the activities of  Exness legal in India. The company is very popular among customers in  this country.** 

&#x200B;

1. They never told you licensed broker WHERE?  which SEBI license??,   Regulated by WHAT? indian regulator? , Which reputable organizations??? .  """" Company is very popular"""" ,  does that mean authenticity? ??  Its  like saying I am a married man regulated by my wife to not cheat on her  told by my local priest (sarcasm) and i am just 19 year old     
 

They claim to have global presence in  
Cyprus  
United Kingdom  
Seychelles  
South Africa  
British Virgin Islands,   

Whats common among these countries?  Best tax haven, Go to place for  someone who does financial crimes because no extradition,  you cant  control either em either.   

Indian government wasn't  able to extradite vijay malya out of UK  for a 9,000 crores scam,  what makes you think they can do anything if  Exness ever runs away with your money?  and for someone claiming to be  settled in UK  ,  They don't even accept retail clients from their own  home country in Europe or the UK.   

Ask yourself why   

**\*\*RBI's guidelines\*\***

I dig deeper and found out that it is backed by dicgc, body of rbi which offers an insurance of upto 5 lakh. So in case it goes bankrupt, we can get upto 5 lakhs back.

Also the deep dive around lockdown 2020 followed with an impressive recovery the very next month.

A solution to technical glitches in brokers apps.,"For eg. I have bought 10 lakhs worth of stocks yesterday in zerodha and I will sell it today. But Zerodha is down(due to any glitch),so I will sell the stocks in a different account with different full service broker eg. Mastertrust (most probably full service broker app or software will not get a glitch, but if it is then they also offer call and trade)
This will create a short position in Mastertrust account.
Now when zerodha will start working again in 1 or 2 hours. I will sell the stocks at market price in zerodha and buy at market price in Mastertrust. By this way I sold my stocks at my target price.
I know the last part of buying and selling at market price will create a difference but it will be nominal loss.

I thought of this method. I hope this will work. And of there is any problem in this method ,do mention it in the comments.",[],0.1,0.0,0.40833333333333327,0.1875

Tata Motors Demerger and TATAMTRDVR,"In July 2023, Tata motors had announced share swap for Tata motors dvr. Tatamtrdvr holders were to get 7 shared of tata motors for every 10 shares of tatamtrdvr. Timeline set for this was about an year. There's nothing else about this after that.

Since they have now announced tata motors demeger of tata motors, it is likely that tata motors share will split and every shareholder will get 1:1 share of each of the two new entities.

Stock Advisors.,"Can anyone suggest if there are any good stock advisors with paid services? I‚Äôm not talking about Youtubers but services like smallcase.

1. Smallcase: I was all set to invest through it but I suspect they misrepresent their CAGR. Also, due to Bull for the last two years, it is very difficult to assess which one is good. Additionally, I also realised that in addition to paying for the smallcase, there are additional charges for each time one places the order.

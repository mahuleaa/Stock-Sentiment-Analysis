How to come out of 35L debt in the form of personal loans which I lost in trading.,"Please help me! 

I am a software professional earning over 1.3L per month since last two years. 

Without proper understanding about trading and markets, I started trading in 2020 and by now I have lost over 66L in total, out of which around 50L was taken as loans. 

Over the past two years I have been able to pay the EMIs with my salary and now the total EMIs are more than my salary and I am unable to last two months EMI. 

I still have around 35L of loan to be repaid. I am out of any options now, I am struggling to keep up with my mental stability and getting suicidal thoughts. 

Kindly help me to get out of this situation.

I have the ability survive in IT industry with my current job. But with the increase in pressure from the lenders for my personal loan, I could  foresee  that I might loose this job as well. 

I don't know how to handle this situation. "
Finally sold all of my stocks today. ,"My portfolio was not generating any net returns because of 49 stocks it had. I had dumped 2.5 lakhs in Jan-2022 and 2 lakhs last month. 

But as of today I had only 3% net returns on that portfolio. So finally sold everything today. I will start now when I am good at finding out stocks. Otherwise I will stay invested in mutual funds only. 

See screenshots attached in comments.

Lost big money in FnO,"I am not sure why I am writing this or how people will react to it.
This is my first post about my trading journey. I started with normal investment during corona time and made around 10 lakh of profit.
Then I ventured into FnO in 2023 September and made around 1 lakh profit by the end of month with mostly wins and few losses.
With newly gained confidence I started big trades in FnO.
Someday I used to make a lakh in day and sometimes loose equally or more.
I made few big mistakes of carrying forward my trade which turned out to be sour.
By the end of December I had lost 40 lakh of my hard earned money.
Giving up was not an option so I continued. I started working on some strategy and things will turn good in my initial trades of the day. But by the end of the day, I would be in loss.
Till today, I have a net loss of 61 lakh rupees.
This is a very big amount for me. The amount that I had earned by working day in and day out.
Feeling bit devastated as I come from a middle class and this sort of money that I had lost would had brought me a ton of things.
Again I am not sure, what I am expecting out of this post or what I am going to do further but just wanted to share.

Please tell me what to do ?,"I am 34 years old , a salaried guy , i started trading after corona ... say May 2020 to till today . I saw trading videos & profit screenshots of other ppl .I got motivated & started trading , i traded because paying of my home loan with is 10L left. I didn't told anybody about it . First I traded with my monthly salary & savings. I did options trading  daily to get huge money easily & all the money became zero. Then started taking loans from bank for trading. All those money went off in trading. For example 1 day I made profit of 10k & very next two days I made loss of 50k loss . Then I lend more money to recover my losses. But it didn't happen , then I took loan from app & it also became zero. I did trading during my working hours, it affected my work life & frustration affected my personal life too. In these 3 years I lost 9L money. I made maximum profit of 40k in a day & maximum loss of 85k in a day. Now I am feeling hopeless. I have total 4 loans from bank & app of worth Rs 14L & having zero savings ..plz tell me what to do? ... It became a habit of options trading..i want to leave it .. because of this habit i made loss of 55k today. I am planning a baby nowadays. My family don't know a single thing about it .These loan emis take 65% of salary."

Markets is only for ULTRA RICH,"I may be hated for such a post but I just got to say it. 

Too much retail money is flowing into the markets. To individual stocks and via mutual funds. So if I’m in a position of power or I have a lot of money. My investment would make less sense and the average retail investor would be making better returns than a millionaire.

How do the ultra rich and Banks and therefore government stop this and keep all the money to themselves? Ultimately they are the market and policy makers

1.	⁠FM Sitharaman may increase the tax on CAPITAL GAINS both LTCG and STCG. I’m pretty much certain this will happen in the next budget.(post election)

2.	⁠NSE/BSE will hike their charges for futures and options drastically . May be lesser for stocks. TAXES / stamp duties will also increase.

3. Mutual funds will increase their expense ratios back by policy Rejig and regulations. 

4.	⁠There may be an crash, it may dramaticised to such an extent that the average retail investor like you and me will remove all our money from the markets. There will be a play like there’s blood on the streets. Then at the lowest point the ultra rich will pump in all the money. The low will be lower than the low you have in mind. 

It’s easy in a bull market to say, I’m in it for the long term. Just ride the low and pump in more money at lows. Any retail investor will do that. But most will run out money after a YEAR OR TWO. You will start thinking about taking money out since you’re getting only negative returns. That’s when the ultra rich enter. 

MARKETS NEVER FAVOUR THE AVERAGE RETAIL INVESTOR. Markets are made by the ultra rich and it will always favour them. MARKETS is not an EQUAL GROUND. They just spin you the story but it is definitely not a fair ground.

This all only a PROBABILTY. But it’s not like it has never happened. "
Rant: I find most people in this community dumb,"Whenever they post their portfolio of give an opinion about a stock, they can't write why they think this stock will do well. 

I find the valuepickr.com forum more useful than this community. Can we all do like what they are doing? 

Share stats, resources, more nuanced opinions, insights on a particular stock. "
Options trading is a State sanctioned scam. ,"5 yrs in options & I've lost everything. Relationship with family & friends has gone downhill. My family no longer respects me. They don't seek my opinion when anything important is abt to happen at home. I feel like nothing these days. Everything has been ruined by none other but me.
Options trading truly is a state sanctioned scam. No idea how many individuals like me have lost their everything in options. "
What is this electoral bonds scam ,"Hi guys I am trying to understand what’s happening with this electoral bonds, I am really new to the concept as I have never heard of it before. I would really appreciate if someone can help me understand this in a very basic way. Is it related to some public investments or how ? Will this have an impact on market or not and so on. 


Please be kind as I am trying to just get the understanding about this and learning something new. "

Stop blaming SEBI chairperson,"Stop blaming SEBI’s chairperson. She was just trying to caution you against dangers. 

At expensive valuations, just a trigger is needed for markets to fall. This trigger can be anything. 

Some war in a distant country, listing of some company, government’s change in policy, and just a statement. 

In 2022’s start, IT companies fell heavily (20-45% in mid cap) due to interest rate changes in US followed by a war in Ukraine.

Long-term result? Today they’re touching ATH.

I can give plenty of examples of this non-correlated falls. I am not talking about events that fundamentally change businesses like Covid boosting Indian steel and chemical demand.

Instead of blaming SEBI chairperson for her statements, newbies should take lessons and move forward. Analyse businesses not only share prices. "
100% Possible?  MANY NEW TRADERS & NEWBIES WILL BE FLUSHED OUT THIS YEAR. ,"
Whether you believe me or not save my above tweet. Many new trader who have came in last 1-2 years will be flushed out this year. Investors are too opptimistic and they have seen non stop teji in last 3 years. BULL market is easy to make money. Thoughest time are during Bear market.

1. Greed level is very high in Indian market. Many retailers expecting 10-20% returns every month. No one is talking about risk, everyone is interested in returns.
2. People are forseeing too much certainity in Indian Eq market, but one of the most imp characteristics of Stok market is that they are most undercatin.
3. DIIs pumping SIP money at forward 3/5 years valuation. Every new month we Experiencing new theories of Investments.
4. Retailers attraction towards Option trading has increased tremendously. Recent rise in FNO volume is scarying me daily.
5. This point can be little sensetive but nothing polictical. Everyone is betting on Indian growth story, Indian Infra Story, Indian being fastest economy, India India India. I proud to hear and be part of this, but we all know many things are dependent on one single party, one single leader.
6. Stock rallying based on Fundamentals are good but if that rally is based on influence then can lead to some bad ending. Recent exceptional rally in PSUs in last 3 months has been based on influence, which may trap many retailers.

I would again repeat here, for CY24. Wait for opportunity, go slow and expect flattish return only. Don't expect every year to be same, anyone would have made minimum 30/40% in last 8-12 months. Next year even closing flat will be best return. 

I believe even if we get flattish return in potfolio in FY25 or CY24 then it would be good.

Only two things can save you from this:
1. Reduce your Greed level
2. Reduce your positioning sizing / Risk.

Rant - this sub is full of shitposts!,"I've been following this sub for quite some time and have observed that the quality of this sub has dropped drastically. Although there are few quality posts but all I see is -

2. I am 20 years old with 20 lacs. Where should I invest?
3. I have 1 cr in my account. Where should I invest?
4. I am a student with 1 lakh. Where should I invest?
5. I want 1000% returns in 6 months. Where should I invest?
6. I have 50 lacs. Where should I invest?
7. What should I do with my dad's retirement money?

Other questions - 

1. I am a student. Should I do FnO?
2. FnO is a scam. 
3. Should I do FnO with ""Don't"" as a standard templated response. 
4. I invested 2 months ago, and my stock/ MF is not performing well. What should I do?
5. Should I sell / buy this stock?
6. Why is this stock performing well and not going down?
7. When will the market crash happen?

And many other posts like this. Almost every other post is just like this, and it doesn't make any sense to post it again and again. 

Why can't people do simple research before posting such things? Or don't think about it?"

"BJP vs Congress, effect on your investment. Hoping to put some sense in people (non-political post)","Lately I see everyone is asking on various forums about what happens  if BJP loses, will it crash the market. Their logic, BJP is doing great  so market will keep go full speed if BJP wins.

All of this is crap and does not hold any water in long term. This  is a non-political post, as Market does not care who wins, in long term.

Below screenshot link I have shared comparison of returns (Nifty and Sensex)  for time Congress was in power (Apr 2004- March 2014) and BJP (March  2014 - Till date).

[Congress vs BJP - Market returns](https://imgur.com/a/1sgyRao)

Overall returns are 250-280% for both.

Hope it makes sense to all. The overall returns are similar. So stop worrying so much about which party wins.

We invest in good companies, not directly in Nifty or Sensex. If a  specific company /industry drops because of govt policy, then the money  flows into another sector/company. The money goes back into the market.

Please feel free to correct me if my understanding is incorrect."
People are AFRAID and so its the right time to buy UNDERVALUED stocks!!!!!,"Smallcap and Midcap stocks are taking a big hit this month and people have started selling them. This is maybe the best time to buy Undervalued stocks. So, suggest few stocks as per your analysis(Mention the analysis) which will grow in coming time for which others can research and invest in. Suggest stocks with good fundamentals and technicals showing growth prospect in future."
"SIP ₹10,000 for 10 years","I’m thinking of investing ₹10,000/month as SIP for 10 years.

Options I’m thinking of :-
a) Quant small cap fund direct growth plan
b) PNB metlife mid cap plan (here after 10 years I’ll stop my SIP and then money will grow for another 10 years)

Goal - Wealth creation

Am I taking right decision? What are your thoughts??"
I followed this one easy rule ,You will aslo easily make 1lakh rupee from market by option buying if you do this first thing you just need bank balance of something around 20 -10 lakh and then buy option from tips and social influencers easily your account will left with only 1lakh and you can achieve lucky number which given by India to the world 0. You can also bypass the matrix and you can achieve profit with - this symbol in demat account if you do overtrading best of luck

Share market trolling me fr 😭😭😭,"
Winning at what cost 😭

So, I'm totally a beginner in the stock market. I had a small capital and started dabbling with IPOs. Got lucky with Tata Tech, Doms, Happy Forging… Then, I invested the money in Tata Motors. Within weeks, it went up by approximately 100 points, but I didn’t invest my full capital, so the return was low. Sold Tata Motors @934 and then randomly, out of nowhere, bought NHPC @64. Again, a low amount. (Like I seriously didn’t even know what NHPC as a company does 😭) Sold it @103, then bought Adani Green Energy at 1886. Now it's @1958 something. This was not on the luck side, as I know it would eventually go up as elections are on the way. The luck side went to Jio Fin 😭😭. Bought Jio Fin randomly, like seriously, I had some amount left after buying the Adani, so I just opened the search bar, and it showed Jio Fin in my recent search, so I bought it @280 but only fking 5 shares 😭😭😭, again a low amount.

Bc it feels like the god of the share market is trolling me fr 😭.

Bhai log, it's okay if you want BJP to win but 90% of comments were mostly like 

""Looser, did you miss rally "" 

""Are you congress supporter "" 

""Rahul Gandhi is pappu ""

A investor in Chennai during the market crash in 2002-03 sold his house because he felt markets are extremely oversold and his story became an example for catching valuations at right time for many of us discussing about markets in old Yahoo groups, which no more exists. He got astronomical returns and he obviously bought a house. I will link the story here once I find it, if any of you learned have it please post it in comments. 


Now, look at this group, it's full of illogical arguments flying everywhere mocking an opinion which can even turn out to be true 

Did any National media tell you that BJP will loose Karnataka assembly elections? They are worst only told you it's hung 


Did any media tell you how Shivsena can go against BJP in Maharashtra once results declared ? They formed an unthinkable alliance


Last time, Donald Trump almost went like he's winning, even our PM who has best sources felt Donald could win and campaigned for him, what was the result? Ever througt of hardship India had to face during corona outbreak because Biden wanted to make India wait ? Thank God it dint get extended to other important issues. 


Media had similar sentiments during 2002 and what happened to vajpayee govt ? Opposition parties looked dull and everyone criticized them in media, but on ground ? It was BJP vs Rest, BJP lost badly 

---------++++++---------+++++---------++++++-------

Even BJP has their Plan B ready in case if they loose

But you guys are so addicted to money that most of you have blocked honest opinions coming into this forum, question yourself, aren't you greedy echo chamber? 

Look at the Chennai investor story I shared, just jump when valuations are attractive, stay away when it's costly because nobody comes to your protection when it melts, your stop loss is a joke when big guys press Ctrl+S, you can do Ctrl+ B only if you nonstop money supply. 

Having 2024 elections  BJP twice, I wish there be a change now, markets might not fall too much but it's definitely overheated for now 

Go ahead and do the usual downvoting you guys good at. "

Monkey and the Stock Market,"The popular Monkey story with valuable lessons for stock market investors.

You’ll love the story and it’ll be in your minds when you make wrong investments in the stock market.




Once upon a time, a rich man from the city arrived in a village. He announced to the villagers that he would buy Monkeys for ₹ 100 each.

The villagers were very happy, after all there were hundreds of Monkeys in a nearby forest.

They caught the Monkeys and got them to the rich man. He bought hundreds of Monkeys and paid ₹ 100 for every Monkey the villagers gave him.

They began to make a living out of getting Monkeys from the forest and selling it to the rich man.


Soon, the forest began to run out of monkeys that were easy to catch.

Sensing this, the rich man offers ₹ 200 for every monkey. The villagers were ecstatic.

They went back to the forest, set up traps and caught the monkeys and got them to the rich man.

A few days later, the rich man announced he would pay ₹ 300 per monkey.

The villagers began climbing trees and risking their lives to catch monkeys and get them to the rich man – who bought them all.

There were no Monkeys left in the forest!

One day, the rich man announced he would like to buy more monkeys – this time for ₹ 800 each.

The villagers couldn’t believe this. They were desperately trying to get more monkeys..

Meanwhile, the rich man said he had to go back to the city on some business work and until he returns his manager would deal on his behalf.

Once he left, the villagers were unhappy. They were making quick and easy money from selling monkeys, but the forest no longer had monkeys.

This is when the manager of the rich man stepped in.

He made an offer the villagers could not refuse.

Pointing out to all the monkeys that the rich man had caged. He told the villagers he would sell the monkeys for ₹ 400 each.

“Sell them back to the rich man at ₹ 800 each when he comes back” the manager said.

The villagers were over the moon. Buy for 400 and sell for 800 in few days. They had just found the easiest way to double their money.

The villagers collected all their savings and even borrowed money.

There were long queues and within a few hours, almost all the monkeys were sold out.

Unfortunately, their happiness did not last long, as the manager went missing the next day and the rich man never came back.

Many villagers kept the monkeys with them, hoping the rich man would come back. But soon, they lost hope and had to let the monkeys back into the forest as feeding and taking care of the noisy monkeys became extremely difficult.

What does the monkey story on stock market actually mean?
Well, if you haven’t understood the analogy already – this is exactly what happens when you buy low-quality companies in the stock market.

There will be a low-priced stock which no one is interested to buy. A few rich men will suddenly start buying it.

The stock price will rise, because there are suddenly a lot of buyers and very few sellers. Classic case of huge demand and no supply – like the Monkeys in the forest.

The stock gets plenty of coverage on business channels and newspapers. These rich men will also use tricks like sending out bulk SMSes, asking people to buy the shares for huge returns.


New and inexperienced investors, hoping to double and triple their investment, get lured into them.

And finally the big players who had bought the stock early when no one wanted it, sell it back to inexperienced investors at high prices.

Something similar is happening in few companies right at the moment in the stock market!

One fine day, there will be no buyers and only sellers. Those who bought the stock in the final stages of the rise – will lose their entire investment.

They will hold the monkeys (shares) for a few years, hoping the stock price rises back. It doesn’t and the story ends there.

In short, the moral of the stock market story is – invest only in quality companies that are selling products which customers love and use.

Don’t be greedy, there is no quick money in the stock market or in life.

It takes time and effort to become wealthy. And there are no shortcuts!"

What are some of the most undervalued stock right now for long term?,"By long term I mean atleast 5-10 years. Here are some of my finds:


1. Anuh Pharma: Has already given a return of 162.2% in a year but I feel it's due for more. With a PE of 19.73, it's lower than it's competitors. A company with 0 debt, increasing sales and profit growth, stable ROE and ROCE. One downside is it's a family owned company with promoter holdings around 70%. Any dispute within the family and the share may tank.           




2. Hindalco: Already someone posted it as being the next multibagger for long term. High increase in sales in last years and is supposed to increase even more during or after the elections.            





3. REC Ltd and PFC: Very good PSU stocks which are rising and will probably rise even higher. Lot of analysis already on this sub regarding these stocks, so won't add more. 

           


4. Ashok Leyland: Kind of a cyclic stock which has been moving sideways for a long time. Very good financials and they are trying to expand their buisness by entering into the overseas market with exports to Africa. Sales and profit growth has increased in the last 3 years. May breakout from the 170 zone very soon.

₹110 dividend on a share now priced at ₹475 - Too good to be true?,"Aster DM Healthcare has announced in their Q3 earnings call that they’re planning on dividends of ₹110-120 for Q4 FY24. 

https://reddit.com/link/1awdx1x/video/n0iz0clm8yjc1/player

It translates to a huge **dividend yield of 23%** on current share price, and honestly, it seems too good to be true. So I’m sharing my opinion, primarily to get a third-person perspective from you guys. Do be as brutally honest as you can be.   


But first things first - despite Aster’s top officials verbally committing to it in recording, it’s not certain until they officially vote on and declare it. This announcement is merely their intent going forward.  Combined with the fact that Aster has *never declared any dividends* before, this sudden dividend commitment (not declaration) of ₹110 does seem fishy

&#x200B;

# Part 1: Investment decision

**Short version -** I’m choosing not to invest in this stock for the long term because of volatility concerns, despite a positive outlook.  Instead, I’m immediately entering the stock at 5% of my overall portfolio for a medium-term trade. Might increase exposure to 10% - still thinking about it.  And it’s not all just about drooling at the huge dividend. 

&#x200B;

**Long version**

So let’s move forward with the context first Aster DM Healthcare is a multinational healthcare provider founded by Dr. Azad Moopen in 1987. With its corporate headquarters in Dubai, UAE, and a registered office in Bangalore, India, the company operates across the Middle East and India. Last year, they took a decision to separate the business in GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) and in India. As a part of this effort, they decided to sell **65%** of their stake in GCC business - for an **equity value of $1002 million.** 

$903 million out of this is receivable upon deal closure, and the rest is conditional based on EBITDA achieved during FY24. From the recent earnings transcript, they’re planning to distribute **70-80%** of this consideration as dividend (coming out to ₹110-120 per share) and invest the rest in expansion activities for India. 

&#x200B;

As a part of my investment methodology, I always look for red flags in a company - and I don’t like businesses selling their profit-generating parts without a very strong strategic motive.  And GCC is not some insignificant part - it accounts for 74% of Aster’s revenue For me, this is immediately a possible ***Red flag #1*** for long-term investing. 

The board of Aster reasons that the GCC business is *mature*. They expect the India hospital network to growing exponentially due to the huge demand supply gap, increasing affordability of the population and insurance coverage. And they have *increased their India stake by \~4%* in the last year.   The numbers also say the same story

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kqzyia4e9yjc1.png?width=456&format=png&auto=webp&s=d739a13a87979dc195e908b803a5babda2f7a26d

This is enough strategic motive to sell GCC business and redouble focus on the Indian arm. 

&#x200B;

But put it simply, I don’t like the fact that they’re distributing 70-80% of the money as dividends.  Some of you might disagree with me, but as a personal opinion, I don’t give much consideration to dividends when I choose companies to invest in. I would rather that they invest the money back in the business, thereby growing it.  If Aster were to invest 70-80% of the $903 million and distribute the rest as dividends, I would’ve loved it. But distributing of 70% of your profit from selling a part of your business that generates \~75% of your revenue does not sit well with me. 

Their operational logic makes sense - you can’t suddenly grow at 100, 200%. So you stick to the plan and use the money to fund the *planned growth for the next 2-3 years*. And instead of having rest of the money sit idly in your bank, reward shareholders. Responsible.

But after Mar’24, Aster’s revenue will suddenly decrease by 60-70% and it might make the stock volatile.  Unfortunately, it doesn’t sit well with my long-term investment principle of ‘**Buy and forget.**’ I don’t have enough expertise to navigate this volatility and would rather search for other stocks that better suit my risk & return appetite. I’ll revisit this decision after re-structuring is done and I have a clearer picture of what is to come. 

&#x200B;

# Part 2 - Trading decision

Having said that, a dividend yield of \~23% is still huge and beats many of the targets I set for my trades. So should I enter this stock for a maximum 3-month trade?

For me, a 3-month period is still fairly long for a trade, and the longer the duration is, the more confident I want to be on the stock. Because I don’t want to be glued to my market screen for the next few weeks or months, upset about any fluctuations. 

&#x200B;

>So Question 1 - Am I confident that they’ll declare dividends at least close to their announced value? 

**Short Answer** \-  Yes. They’ve been fairly *consistent with their previous commitments* so far. 

&#x200B;

**Long answer**

For this, I went back to check on their previous commitments

While the numbers of 110-120 are from the Dec’23 earnings call (Released on Feb 14), even in their previous interactions with shareholders, they’d informed that a large part of the proceedings would be given as dividends. There were consistent updates on their intentions to separate GCC and India business, and further on selling a stake in their GCC business. 

Even for business guidance, previously they’d announced intention of *cost reduction programmes* and it has worked in the Dec’23 quarter. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/43ld45igbyjc1.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb964a211ee5ddd86ea9f53dad93449d5c1b0bf1

They’d committed a 2-3% reduction in total costs and are halfway towards it. They’d also guided a further expectation of 1-1.5% reduction in costs. They’re making progress towards their commitment in reducing HR costs too.

All in all, they’re pretty consistent with their verbal commitment to shareholders - with business guidance in general, the GCC business and also with their intentions about distributing dividends.

>Question 2 - What about the company in general?    

**Short answer** \- Company has strong vision, good cash flow, revenue growth and is improving profitability. Dec’23 has been a turnaround quarter. Valuation is competitive when compared with its peers. And shareholding also signals stability in price. 

&#x200B;

**Long answer**

**Operations**

Q3 has been the **turnaround quarter** for Aster.

With a PBT of ₹242 cr, Aster broke the *5-month streak of de-growing profits*. One quarter of growth at the backdrop of 5 quarters of de-growth is generally not convincing - but I’m of the opinion that this is not a one-time scenario for 3 reasons

1. Revenue had been growing near-consistently. Aster only had a problem with cost-management

https://preview.redd.it/5fh0ysxpbyjc1.png?width=1110&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7d5417e13595f022020bd1fc28dd12bb5859166

2. We see that Aster had shifted management focus to cost-reduction in the previous quarters, and this result might be a direct effect of those efforts. And India business has higher margins - so post Q4, this will also come into play. 

3. Currently *hospitals segment* contributes to 57% of revenue & 66% of profits with margins over 20%. They’ve been investing in other verticals of healthcare ecosystem - where margins are improving gradually. Aster expects Lab networks to **breakeven by Q4 FY24** and pharmacy networks to break even in the next 1-2 years.  

&#x200B;

Cash flow from operating activities is also consistently increasing with a **CAGR of 14.5%** over the last 10 years.

&#x200B;

**Valuation**

Aster has a current **P/E of 73.**

While this is still lower than the industry average of 80-90, I feel that Aster’s P/E shot up majorly because of 2 quarters - Sep’23 saw a net loss of ₹30.8 cr and Jun’23 saw only a marginal profit.  The situation would’ve been much better if not for exceptional expense of ₹19cr for *restructuring fees* and a *provision* of ₹42 cr one of it’s GCC subsidiaries. 

With improving profitability, forecasters estimate a forward PEG of 40-50, which is great competitive value for a company in the Healthcare facilities industry. 

&#x200B;

**Shareholding**

As far as shareholding is concerned, promoters increased their stake by \~4% in Mar’23 quarter, but at the same time, **pledged** their shares too. 

Now, most websites have promoter pledge as 98.87% - but Dr. Moopen, the founder, has clarified that his actual exposure is infact limited to $*80million* (equal to *\~10% of promoter holding*, and not 99%) And this was taken majorly to *increase their stake* during the same quarter.  I don’t know exactly what technicality resulted in this allegedly wrong value of 98.87%, but for now, I place my faith in him.  Because he has been consistent - during Mar’23, Dr. Moopen had clarified that this pledge will reduce to minimum in a year, and 3 months ago, he reiterated that the pledge will *become minimal once he gets the dividends* from the sale of GCC business.  

After promoter, DIIs and FIIs hold a majority of the company, and Public exposure is merely 9.6% of the total holdings, and decreasing in the last quarter Of that 9.6%, 2 NRIs hold 3.38% of the company - not because they’re NRIs but because they own more than 1% stake in the company. Generally, I assume that these are **stable holdings**.

So as far as I’m concerned, only 6.22% of the company is subject to *volatile/true* free-float. 

As a result, a low and reducing public holding % is good news for me, and is signs of stability in price - which is seen in the stocks’s beta of 0.33 over the past year. 

&#x200B;

**Misc**

Other than this, they have a healthy debt-equity ratio of .56, healthy financials (Pitroski score of 7).

The return ratios (RoE, RoCE & RoA)  are lower when compared with the industry standards - but these are also bound to improve post sale of GCC business

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/550aaju8cyjc1.png?width=2402&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fb87770e9e3009ecdca984f7f596572c9973373

As far as overall business is concerned, they’re majorly concentrated in Kerala and south of India. Occupancy levels have reached 80% in Kerala, so their expansion targets are high there. Geographically, they’re also looking for inorganic growth opportunities in north India - especially Uttar Pradesh & Maharastra where they feel that there is a huge demand-supply gap. 

Government initiatives like PM-JAY is increasing demand, and Aster is poised well to exploit this growth as they are focused on Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities expansion. 

&#x200B;

>Final Question - How much do I enter, and when?

You can skip this part because as far as the share price is concerned, we can have greatly differing views. I’ve just outlined my thought process below - and would appreciate any opposing views or more insights. 

&#x200B;

Due to historical low volatility and low true free-float shares (<7%), I **don’t expect** a major correction in the share price. My perspective is that even if there is a major correction, the dividend declared will be all the more attractive at the lower share price - which means that stock will rally just before the ex-date. 

Technical momentum is also strong, looking like it has entered a new consolidation phase after the recent run-up on Feb 15. 

&#x200B;

And therefore, I’ve entered with 5% of my portfolio (not much in rupee value to be honest, as I don’t have much money lol) currently. More news on formalities and deal closure of the GCC sale should come in the next few weeks. By then, (and also based on the price movement), I’m planning to add another 5%, increasing my exposure in Aster to a total of 10% of my portfolio - which is the *max limit* I’ve decided for any particular stock, however confident I am. 

&#x200B;

Finally, unless or otherwise my viewpoint is fundamentally challenged (changes to dividend declaration), I feel like an SL is *irrelevant* for this trade due to it’s particular circumstance - wherein the lower the stock price falls, the more attractive the dividend will become, and thereby more pronounced will the forthcoming rally be.

Have you calculated how much should be the size of your SIP for it to be worth 100 Cr when you turn 60?,"While the number will vary with age and other variables but given the average population I thought it might be interesting to trigger some imagination

Approx SIP of 60-70k per month is likely to make you 100 cr by the time you reach 60.

Another rally,"This is going to be a long post so you can ignore if you don’t want to read some geeky stuff. Our markets rallied on Friday after GDP numbers, yes the numbers have beaten expectations but as the experts are saying that we might not sustain such numbers because of the fact that private consumption is still not growing. Now coming to the stock markets, few days ago I posted about most of the stocks, especially the PSUs being too expensive and since then there has been some correction in them. But I think there’s room for more and it will come unexpectedly and eat a lot of gains that people have made since November. The gains people are getting in quant funds are not sustainable as markets cannot grow unreasonaby high every year, I also got a feeling that people in this sub are not very open to discussions but they like to hate on someone saying that the stock they bought is overvalued. My father has been in the markets since the time of Harshad Mehta, he has seen how people lose most of their gains and incur huge losses bcz of operators. If a correction comes, it may turn out to be deep enough to make 80-90% of retail traders stuck with losses and you’ll not be able to figure out if you should hold or just exit at whatever loss you might be bearing. I have studied economics and even the analysts, economists are sure that India’s domestic demand is not anywhere near the west and we’re just being too optimistic about the Indian companies. To those who are defending PSU stocks, just think wisely that these companies work for welfare and working on welfare can’t make you huge profits, same goes with the PSU banks, if all of us are investing and not keeping money in the banks, then these banks will lose deposits and Idk how will they even be profitable without having enough funds. This post is not to hurt someone’s sentiments but just an advice to people that making 40-50% return in 2-3 months is great but book your profits before it’s too late. I’m not hating on any partifular company but what I’m trying to say is that domestic consumptions is too low to facilitate the profits that corporates and the government are promising. "

Don't panic and do this ,"Just wanted to share my two cents basis a few seperate queries I got on chat

1. This is a correction and upto 5 percent at index level is normal. My guess on the worst will be nifty at 21500-600

2. Large cap stocks are not likely to go below 50 dema, exceptions maybe there. So bottom of your large cap stocks is likely to be there

3. Small and mid caps, if you are holding in derivatives, then exit, but if you are holding via stocks
A. Continue holding mid caps if your stock has corrected by over 15 percent from its high in last one month
B. Small cap - hold only if it's below July 2023 level, else exit


This is a very good time to add investments for long term and don't miss this opportunity"

Do you think we are walking into a stock market crash? ,"Please mention your opinion and do explain the reasoning behind

Why do I think we are walking into a stock market crash? 
1. Stocks have given a 40-50% (even more) return in the last 2 years. This is unsustainable as the returns should revert to mean for a longer duration
2. Small caps have doubled. The amount of trust on small caps versus large caps is an indicator of misplaced optimism in the market. 


Why do I see a rally ahead? 
1. Interest rate should go down from here, so the market should really
2. PE of the index is high (~20%) but not extravagant. We might justify it with the Indian growth story narrative
3. The indexes have rallied without FIIs becoming a party to it. Should they believe in India story, China +1 strategy, money should come in.

After cutting down expenses of living in Mumbai on rent and everything else, I’m left with about 20k disposable income to invest or rot in my bank account.

Help me convince my father ,"Starting this year, I introduced my father to the stock market, and he has taken a lot of interest in it. This week, I taught him how to use a Demat account, including how to buy and sell stocks. He made some purchases of Tata Steel and IOC based on his own research. Now, he wants to invest in penny stocks, saying, 'How much money can we lose anyway?' How can I explain the risks to him and convince him not to do that?"

I invested in Paytm- this happened

I invested in Zeel- sony deal controversy and fell hard

How an Advisor's Fees Can Overtake an Investor's Portfolio Over Time,"I've stumbled upon a fascinating scenario that puts into perspective the long-term impact of advisory fees on an investor's portfolio. Imagine an investor who starts with a lump sum of 100 rupees for simplicity's sake, invests through an advisory service that yields a 15% annual return, but charges a 2% fee on the entire portfolio at the end of each year. Now, let's assume the advisor invests these fees in their own portfolio, also earning a 15% return annually.

After running some calculations, the results after 40 years are quite eye-opening:

* **Investor's Portfolio:** Starts with 100 rupees, grows at 15% annually, but pays a 2% fee each year. After 40 years, the portfolio is worth approximately **11,938.69 rupees**.
* **Advisor's Portfolio:** Starts with 0 rupees, but invests the 2% fee collected from the investor's portfolio each year, also growing at 15% annually. After 40 years, the advisor's portfolio is worth approximately **17,074.82 rupees**.

The advisor, who started with zero, ends up with a larger portfolio than the investor who started with 100 rupees. This is a stark illustration of how fees, compounded over time, can significantly erode an investor's returns and enrich the advisor.

This scenario highlights the importance of understanding the long-term impact of advisory fees and the power of compounding. It's a reminder that when it comes to investing, every percentage point in fees matters, and it's crucial to make informed decisions about the services we use and the fees we agree to pay.

What are your thoughts on this? Have you ever considered the long-term impact of advisory fees on your investments?"

Hidden gems,"I remember the time when Rakesh Jhunjhunwala was talking about Tata Motors which makes a revenue of 3+ lac crores but had an small mcap of 25000 crores 
At that time , it had just an 2 digit share price.
But today , it's a bit close to become 4 digit share price. It delivered an 1000% return in span of 4 years . 
It was very fascinating to see the turnaround of the Tata Motors.
I have saw some stocks which have an very good amount of revenues but aren't much respected by market .
1 . Rajesh Exports
I saw the revenues and the portfolio of the company. The company manages processing of gold  . It process about 35% of total gold in the world. However , there is an sharp decline in the profitability of the company. 

2.  Piramal Enterprises .
This company is a lot controversial to most of you because of its poor performance this days . However this company is well diversified.

However, if the management works hard in turning the tables of these companies, a big turnaround could be seen in the companies . 
If someone is thinking of investing money for an range of 10+ years , one can make an small position in these . 
However, I am not an financial advisor and to invest in these companies, please first take advice from your financial advisor.

Stonks I regret not investing more in,"FYI I had invested a decent amount in them but I could have invested more and I certain had the funds to do so

1. HEROMOTOCORP - 48% up

3. IRCTC - 40% up
4. LICI - 64% up
5. SUNPHARMA - 55% up
6. MARUTI - 14% up

Some of these shares were suggested by my research analyst and some were my own picks. IOC was my own pic which gave me most returns + dividends.

Ofcourse I haven't mentioned some stocks which haven't performed this great and I have some which are only ETFs that have more than 50% profit. And some stocks are in 10% negative.

Part 2 - General Gyan From An Oldish Timer,"Part 1 - [https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1anziwf/general\_gyan\_from\_an\_oldish\_timer/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1anziwf/general_gyan_from_an_oldish_timer/)

1. There are many ways to make money in the markets. The only way to *reliably* make life changing money *(where you don't need a 9 to 5 job)* is by investing large sums of money at the right price and stay in the market for a sustained period of time.  

2. A lot of people put up screenshots on these Reddit Subs about 300% Gains in IRFC, IREDA etc. The problem with this is since these are mostly new investors, they did not do the research, they bought based on tips so they didn't have the confidence to invest large sums of money. So investing INR 10K which becomes INR 30K in 3 months is nothing but a lost opportunity. There's nothing to celebrate there. Imagine coming to the conclusion *independently* that IRFC @ INR 25 offers enough margin of safety, you could invest INR 10 Lacs instead of INR 10K. That changes things.  

3. Every bull market becomes a breeding ground for pump and dump operations. P&D can be run via a Youtube or Whatsapp or TV channel but the method hasn't changed in the last 100 years. Talk up a stop, keep buying, it hits upper circuit consecutively, the lazy retail investor gets sucked in, the operator dumps the stock, the retail investor gets stuck. Our current laws do not prosecture p&d operators adequately. SEBI simply takes back the money earned + penalty. They need to charge them 10X that.  

4. Even some very skilled buyers are mediocre sellers (this includes me). It takes a decade to learn when to sell. You will not learn this by watching a Youtube channel on 1.5X speed. If you don't know when to sell, you will utter lazy one-liners like *""Time Spent In The Market Is Better Than Timing The Market.""*

Jumping from family business to stock market.,"I am a software engineer my big brother is handling our family business. But since the business is not doing good, He said he will invest in the stock market (even though he doesn't have savings for that). I feel this decision of his is may be influenced by YT reels and friends. I don't agree with his decision, but since I cannot see any other option and he is my brother I decided to support him by providing 10 lakhs (A big amount for me).

I feel without doing hard work you cannot earn money, there must be some skillset which is required for this field.  
Can you please help me with following questions.

1. How can I test that he has some understanding of Stock market and will survive it.
2. What study material or practise will you suggest so that he can be on right path.
3. What other things I can do to help him in this journey?

I have limited knowledge of stock market and given my limited bandwidth I cannot dive deep into this. Thats why I am asking help from you experienced guys.  
I checked ""varsity"" by zerodha, seems like a good start. But I dont know how much of help it will be in the real practical.

HELP ME CONFRONT ZERODHA,"Zerodha is claiming that Yesterday i.e 14th March 2024, not even a single user faced any issue related to the app which got them logged out or which render them unable to place buy/sell their market orders

Yesterday @9:19 am while trying to exit from my current position the app showed a pop up ""something went wrong"" and when I tried to exit once again, I got logged out right after the pop up ""Something went wrong"". Now due to this issue I couldn't exit my position on time and suffered a loss which I had to book later that day.

I didn't take any screenshots of the error or that I was logged out and so without any evidence I confronted zerodha to which they claimed that not a single user of zerodha faced this technical issue which I mentioned that particular day and that the issue was from my end.

Is there anyone who faced any kind of technical issue which made it difficult for them to place the order or got them logged out (on 14th March only) and have got proof, I would really appreciate if you could share this.

Im not looking for any legal actions nor Im trying to get any monetary compensation from them, Im aware that its not gonna happen. I just want to show it to their face when they made this bold claim esp when we're aware of their history with glitches. So if anyone has any proof, pls feel free to attach it

Thanks in advance

PS - Only send if you have genuine proof and not something forged otherwise it'll backfire immensely on me. And I apologise in advance for offending anyone who's a zerodha loyalist."
Public companies on electoral bonds purchaser list,"Would you trust your money on companies that purchased electoral bonds? 

As a value investor, I find it a big red flag - I will exit all my positions in companies that have invested in electoral bonds. These companies' share price may increase in the short term, but over the long term, they are highly likely to be corrupt and will end up lining only their own pockets.

IS PRIVATE BANK BULL RUN COMING ?,so hdfc and kotak bank which are a big contributor to bank 50  which contribute a lot in the Bank 50 . the average PE of banking sector is 15.8 which is very less compared  to other  sectors of the market . and in election the governments  are going to try to  reduce the interest rate to get vote and this year we have Indian n and american elections too. so i can give a bet that the USA FED is going to cut down on the interest  rate beecause the inflation in the economy  is under control. and as the interest rate goes down the profits of the banks is going to increase . i have put 50 percent of my portfolio in banking and financial sector 25 percent in raw material and  manufacturing . and the rest in FMCG .  
PRIVATE BANKS ARE UNDERVALUED ?,"After the so called gambling run of the PSU sectors . the stock market is going to continue to go side ways for 2 months at least. it might go 5 to 6 percent to around 21000 . the sector which i have increased my holdings is Private bank sector Like Hdfc , Au bank and  city union bank because there PE is really low and there growth rate is quite good . i have very good chunk of my portfolio in these private bank sector . the pe of this sector is below average and  most of the bank pe are less than 20.
